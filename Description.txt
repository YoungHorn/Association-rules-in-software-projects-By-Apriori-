Data came from a website created in 1997.

At first, the website was named Freshmeat, and changed to Freecode in 2011.

It is a catalogue that tracks free, free and open source software projects, but it stopped updating in 2014.

This project comes from the 2nd chapter of the book named 《python数据挖掘概念/方法与实践》.

The code comes from github: https://github.com/megansquire/masteringDM/tree/master/ch2
